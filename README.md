# [DEADLINE TRACKER] 

## Basic Details

### Team Name: [Track]

### Team Members
- Member 1: [Rafa] - [NSS Colllege of Engineering, Palakkad]
- Member 2: [Nayana P] - [NSS Colllege of Engineering, Palakkad]

### Hosted Project Link

### Project Description
[Our project is a role-based calendar and task manager designed for Editors and Viewers. Editors can add tasks with a subject, submission date, and optional time, while Viewers can view the schedule in real-time. The system uses color-coded tasks, and persistent storage to make planning and coordination intuitive and efficient.]

### The Problem statement
[Students working in teams often miss assignment deadlines because information is shared across multiple platforms like WhatsApp, notebooks, or individual reminders. There is no single structured space where all members can view, edit, and track assignments together in a simple and organized way.]

### The Solution
[A lightweight, role-based collaborative deadline management system where selected members can edit deadlines and others have view-only access.]
